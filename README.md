# AWS Links

After years of using Firebox bookmarks, open tabs that are lost after an unsuccessful-tabs-restore-after-Firefox-restart, Chrome bookmarks, folders in the menubar, bookmarks in the RSS reader that I forget about, I've decided to dump AWS related links that I find interesting, here. The attempt at categorization is not strict. Note that some of these links are dated and so might the information in them - cleaning that up is something I might do if I have time.
